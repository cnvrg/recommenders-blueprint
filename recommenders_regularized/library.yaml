title: Recommenders RM # required on creation, a slug will be generated from the title? -> inference-library
version: 1.0.0 # required
description: "sample description" # optional
icon: python # optional

# Optional properties for crediting authors
author: "cnvrg"

# At least one tag [inference, training, data] must be present
tags:
  - training

# Available only for training (exec tasks) libraries only
command: python3 Regularized.py

# These will replace the "compute" argument, values must be >= 0:
# We need to add requirement for distributed pods
requirements:
  cpu: 3.5
  memory: 8
  gpu: 0
  hpu: 0

# This will replace the "docker_images" argument (?) need to work in cnvrg as well
image: python:3.8.6

# This will replace "env_setup", currently only python 3 is supported.
language: python3

arguments:
  # Training arguments will have type and value, valid types are [discrete, float, integer, categorical]
  # Empty value will mark the argument as 'required', adding a default value will place it in the flow.
