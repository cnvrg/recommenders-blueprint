You can use this blueprint to recommend similar items to users per their behaviours.
For using this pretrained recommender model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.
1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can use the `Try it Live` section with specific user ids to check your model, in example user id: 2
5. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that recommend similar items to users
