Use this blueprint to recommend similar items to customers according to their behaviors. To use this pretrained recommender model, create a ready-to-use API endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using movie ratings data, specifically the MovieLens 100K Dataset. To use custom data according to your specific business, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/recommenders-train), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy this recommender API endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with a relevant user ID to check your model's predictions.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in your code snippet.

An API endpoint that recommends similar items to users based on their behavior has now been deployed.
